## Usage

### Creating a Podcast

1. **Add segments** — Click "Add Segment" to create new text entries
2. **Write content** — Enter text for each segment
3. **Select voices** — Choose a voice from the dropdown for each segment
4. **Generate audio** — Click "Generate" on each segment to create the audio clip
5. **Preview** — Click "Play" on individual segments or "Play Podcast" for all

### Generating Audio

Each segment has a **Generate** / **Regenerate** button:

- **Generate** — Creates the audio clip for that segment (amber button)
- **Regenerate** — Re-creates the audio if you want a different take
- **Generate All** — Generates all missing audio clips at once
- **Ready** — Green indicator shows the segment has cached audio

> **Tip**: Pre-generating audio ensures consistent playback. Each time you generate, the audio is cached and will play the same way every time — no more "I feel lucky" randomness!

### Playback

- If a segment has cached audio, it plays instantly
- If not cached, it will generate first, then play
- The cache is invalidated when you change text or voice

### Exporting

- **JSON** — Save your project with "Export JSON" to continue editing later
- **Audio** — Click "Download Audio" to export the complete podcast
  - Uses cached audio where available (fast!)
  - Generates missing segments automatically

### Importing

Click "Import" and select a previously saved JSON file to restore your project.

## Configuration

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + VibeVoice TTS
- **Audio**: REST API synthesis with client-side caching
